Please do join our Discord channels and chat there to find out what we are currently up to and discuss hassidut with us. We are freelance and hobby programmers. We work on robotics, javascript frameworks, python frameworks, and APIs. Feel free to join the org and work with us. No contribs or PRs on Shabbat.
